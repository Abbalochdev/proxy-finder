pip install .
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Fetch proxies
proxy-finder fetch -n 5

# Fetch specific number of proxies
proxy-finder fetch -n 10

# Fetch proxies from specific country
proxy-finder fetch -c US -n 5

# Fetch proxies from multiple countries
proxy-finder fetch -c US,GB,DE -n 10

proxy-finder validate

# Rotate proxies
proxy-finder rotate

# List available countries
proxy-finder countries
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Fetch with specific anonymity level
proxy-finder fetch -c US -a anonymous -n 5

# Set custom timeout
proxy-finder fetch -t 5.0 -n 5

# Sort by speed
proxy-finder fetch -s speed -n 5

# Sort by country
proxy-finder fetch -s country -n 5

# Sort by anonymity level
proxy-finder fetch -s anonymity -n 5
```

## Command Reference

```bash
# Available commands
proxy-finder fetch     # Fetch proxies from sources
proxy-finder validate  # Validate proxy connections
proxy-finder rotate    # Rotate between proxies
proxy-finder countries # List available countries

# Common options
-n, --number    # Number of proxies to retrieve
-c, --country   # Two-letter country code (e.g., US, GB)
-a, --anonymity # Anonymity level (transparent, anonymous, elite)
-t, --timeout   # Connection timeout in seconds
-s, --sort      # Sort results by field (speed, country, anonymity)
```

## Proxy Information

Each proxy displays the following information:

- IP Address and Port
- Country of origin
- Anonymity level
- Response speed
- Authentication status
- Last checked timestamp

## Best Practices

1. Always validate proxies before using them
2. Use appropriate timeouts based on your needs
3. Rotate proxies regularly to maintain reliability
4. Monitor proxy performance using the speed metric
5. Use country filtering for location-specific tasks
6. Choose appropriate anonymity levels for your use case

## Troubleshooting

- If no proxies are found, try:
  - Using different countries
  - Increasing the timeout
  - Checking your internet connection
  - Using different anonymity levels

- If proxies are slow:
  - Sort by speed
  - Use a shorter timeout
  - Try different proxy sources

## Security Notice

- Never use untrusted proxies for sensitive operations
- Always validate proxy connections
- Use appropriate authentication when required
- Monitor proxy performance regularly
- Rotate proxies frequently for security

## Performance Tips

1. Use appropriate timeouts (default: 10 seconds)
2. Sort proxies by speed for best performance
3. Use country filtering to reduce latency
4. Rotate proxies regularly to maintain reliability
5. Monitor proxy performance metrics

## Future Development

Planned features:

- More proxy sources
- Enhanced validation methods
- Better error handling
- Additional sorting options
- More detailed statistics
- Improved country filtering
- Better proxy rotation algorithms
- Additional proxy metrics
- More configuration options
